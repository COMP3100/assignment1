Instructions:
For	a	given	job	ji,
  Obtain server state information
    For each server type i, si, from the smallest to the largest
      For each server j, si, j of server type	si,	from 0 to	limit	- 1	//j	is server	ID
        If server si, j has sufficient available	resources	to run	job	ji then
          Return si, j
        End	If
    End	For
  End	For
Return	the	first	Active	server	with	sufficient	initial	resource	capacity	to	run	job	ji
